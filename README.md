# 🏠AHouse Price Predictor

An interactive **Machine Learning web application** that predicts house prices based on property characteristics such as **sq### 🤖 AI-Powered Price Predictionuare footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and property age**.

The application combines a trained regression model with a modern **Streamlit dashboard** and interactive **Plotly visualizations** to provide property valuation insights.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Estimating the value of a property depends on multiple factors.

This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning Regression** can be used to analyze housing information and generate an estimated property value.

Users enter property details through an interactive interface, and the trained ML model instantly generates a predicted price along with useful market analytics.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Price Prediction

Predict the estimated value of a property using inputs such as:

* 📐 Square Footage
* 🛏️ Number of Bedrooms
* 🚿 Number of Bathrooms
* 🏗️ Property Age

The prediction is generated using a pre-trained **Scikit-learn regression model**.

---

### 📊 Dynamic Valuation Gauge

Displays the predicted property value through an interactive gauge chart.

It helps visualize how the estimated value compares with the average market value.

---

### 📈 10-Year Valuation Trajectory

Provides a visual representation of:

* Historical property value
* Current estimated value
* Projected future valuation

This helps users understand potential property value trends.

---

### 🕸️ Property Radar Analysis

An interactive radar chart compares the selected property specifications with typical market characteristics.

Comparison factors include:

* Square Footage
* Bedrooms
* Bathrooms
* Property Age

---

### 💰 Property Analytics

The dashboard also calculates useful property metrics such as:

**Value per Square Foot**

```text
Predicted Property Value
────────────────────────
Total Square Footage
```

**Estimated Monthly Mortgage**

Provides an approximate monthly payment based on the predicted property value.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JASH2026AD/PROJECT-03-AI-HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTOR.git
```

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd PROJECT-03-AI-HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTOR
```

---

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Run the Application

Start the Streamlit development server:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

in your browser.

---

# 🧠 Model Training

The repository already contains a trained model:

```text
model.joblib
```

Therefore, you can run the application directly without retraining the model.

If you want to retrain the model using the housing dataset, run:

```bash
python generate_and_train.py
```

The script trains the Machine Learning model and generates an updated:

```text
model.joblib
```

file.
